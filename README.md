# Wordcount
Code to find the number of lines, number of words, and number of characters present in a file.

Task: Keep track of the number of lines you find in the file, the number of words in the file (whitespace characters separated by non-whitespace
characters) and total characters. If it is a whitespace character and the previous character was not a whitespace character, your word count
should increase. If it is a newline character, the number of lines should increase and if the previous character was not a newline or whitespace,
your word count should increase.
